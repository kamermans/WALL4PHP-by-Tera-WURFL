In Wall4PHP 1.1_TeraWurfl2 since Wall4PHP 1.1
*) Added support for the Tera-WURFL Remote Webservice

*) Improved User Agent Detection System to detect the actual User Agent even when Proxies
   and Opera Mini mask them.

*) Added support for Tera-WURFL v2.x (Steve Kamerman, David, Alex).

*) This version works with PHP Tools, Tera-WURFL 1.x and Tera-WURFL 2.x


In Wall4PHP 1.1 since Wall4PHP 1.01

*) Great minor version number change.

*) 100% compatible with PHP5.

*) Works with Tera WURFL. You just need to download Tera WURFL, extract it into (already
   created but empty) folder tera-wurfl at the Wall4PHP root. Then you will need to
   configure it. When it's done, you need to change value of WALL_USE_TERA_WURFL
   configuration constant (check with wall_prepend.php) and include
   tera-wurfl/tera_wurfl_config.php, not wurfl/wurfl_config.php (with this release
   wall_prepend.php choses which config to inlcude by value of WALL_USE_TERA_WURFL).
   Thanks to Joan Blaas for reminding about this late todo list item.
        Affected files: tera-wurfl/* (empty directory)
                        wall_prepend.php
                        Wall.php

*) Added doctype for cHTML (Compact HTML 1.0 Draft) - thanks to Natalia Pujol.
        Affected files: Wall/Element/Xmlpidtd.php
        
*) Fixed bad correlation of <tr> and <td> tags when attrib "colnum=1" - thanks to Natalia
   Pujol.
        Affected files: Wall/Element/Cool_menu.php

*) Removed charset portion from content-type headers being sent by wall:document. With 
   this LG KG800 (Chocolate) could not display page.
        Affected files: Wall/Element/Document.php

*) Fixed bug in preferred markup detection, if decision is based on HTTP_ACCEPT header. 
   The problem was with missing 'break' statement after switch case. A little 
   modification also was made - if browser reports that it likes text/html, we return 
   xhtmlmp as preferred markup. 
        Affected files: Wall/TagUtil.php

*) Fixed logic bug in Wall object. Non critical.
        Affected files: Wall.php
        
*) Fixed bug when no Accept HTTP header is present but Wall's WALL_PARSE_HTTP_ACCEPT
   is defined. It caused no content rendered due unknown prefered markup.
        Affected files: Wall/TagUtil.php

*) Rewrote xhtml_preferred_charset anbd xhtmlmp_preferred_mime_type handling. If first
   is "utf8", no problems. If "iso8859", we omit it, because there are too many subsets
   of this encoding. Change affects only xhtml output (not chtml or wml), of course.
        Affected files: Wall/Element/Document.php
        
*) Forgot to mention it in previous changelog, so here it goes: Wall4PHP from v1.01
   does not generate a lot of whitespace itself. Still, this does not solve problem
   with alternate_img and alike (tags, which are removed by Wall4PHP). Whitespace,
   which occurs before and after those tags.
        Affected files: Wall/Element/*

*) Wall4PHP did not work as expected, if attribute value was inside single quotes (')
   instead of double ("). Now it is fixed. Also, you can mix quotes (ex: attr="val'ue"
   attr2='val"ue'). Parser should not go mad about it. If any bugs occure, you can
   allways switch back to old version, by commenting out new regular expression
   (inserting # at the start of line #94 in file Wall/wallXmlParser.php).
        Affected files: Wall/wallXmlParser.php
        
*) Changed behaviour of <wall:menu> items, when autonumber is not set, or is set to
   "false". In this case list is outputted (except when fancy one is brought up) with
   <ul>, as opposed to <ol>. Sorry, Luca, hope this does not bring much problems around.
   This feature was hugely requested.
        Affected files: Wall/Element/A.php

*) Small typo led to empty "size" attribute, when multiple was set to "true". Fixed.
        Affected files: Wall/Element/Select.php

*) HTML entities within attributes of any non-Wall elements were not decoded/encoded 
   properly. For example, name="val&amp;ue" became name="val&amp;amp;ue". The same applied 
   to other entities (&quot;, for example). Fixed, of course.
        Affected files: Wall.php

*) Checks on emptyok generated E_NOTICE and did not work. Fixed.
        Affected files: Wall/Element/Input.php

*) Latest WURFL.xml from CVS. As usual.
        Affected files: wurfl/data/*


In Wall4PHP 1.01 since Wall4PHP 1.0

*) Updated Andrea's PHP Tools to version V2.1 Beta2 (hopefully "beta" is not for
   "beta":)
        Affected files: wurfl/*
        
*) Bundled with newest WURFL XML file (MD5: 760a4b88345a204d717bcf57605b9fe4)
        Affected files: wurfl/data/wurfl.xml

*) Added type="text/css" to <style> tag (wall:menu_css and wall:coolmenu_css elements)
        Affected files: Wall/Element/Menu_css.php
                        Wall/Element/Cool_menu_css.php

*) Fixed default background colors within wall:menu_css, if colorize was set.
        Affected files: Wall/Element/Menu_css.php

*) Due to popular demand, I've added another optional GET parameter (besides UA). So,
   if you open WALL4PHP page with GET parameter markup set to wml, xhtmlmp or chtml,
   it will return specified content type, still for that device specified via user
   agent or forced via UA GET parameter. example.php?UA=Nokia6600&markup=WML would force
   rendering for Nokia 6600 (generic) within WML (though, default for this device is
   XHTMLMP)
        Affected files: Wall/TagUtil.php

*) Changed default LOG_LEVEL to LOG_ERR (was LOG_INFO)
        Affected files: wurfl/wurfl_config.php

*) If device prefers other content-type (WURFL property xhtmlmp_preferred_mime_type),
   we are kind enough to give it to it. Except when forced WML or CHTML, of course :)
        Affected files: Wall/Element/Document.php

*) Parser again. Modified Wall internal parser to behave when user mixes wall markup
   with hard-coded wml/xhtml/chtml markup.
        Affected files: Wall.php

*) Moved closing tags (</wml> and </html>) from wall:document to wall:body  (to keep things
   more clean, because start element for wall:document does not output anything, so,
   end element should not too.
        Affected files: Wall/Element/Body.php
        Affected files: Wall/Element/Document.php

*) Added two attributes to wall:img because of often request by community: width and height.
   If ommited, no width and height is being applied.
        Affected files: Wall/Element/Img.php




In Wall4PHP 1.0 since Wall4PHP beta2

*) All known bugs are fixed :)
*) First stable release!




In Wall4PHP beta2 since Wall4PHP beta1

*) Fixed very very annoying bug in XML parser which would break WALL4PHP output. 
*) Introduced IMG tag and headings (H1-H6).
*) Replaced PHP short tags ("<?") with their long versions ("<?php") (in some files:)
*) Modified example body.php ("<?=" to "<?php echo")
*) Fixed bug that caused duplicate </body> at the end of document in XHTML mode.
*) New example to reflect new changes - examples/beta2.php
*) New example to reflect interaction with PHP and $wall object. (examples/php.php)
*) Removed trailing spaces, which occured if we wrote something like:
     <? require_once('../wall_prepend.php'); ?>
     <wall:document><wall:xmlpidtd />
   instead of 
     <? require_once('../wall_prepend.php'); ?><wall:document><wall:xmlpidtd />
*) PHP5 compatibility (get_class() issue, found by outstrung317)
*) Fixed problem with long phone numbers in caller element. They were converted to
   int and overflew. Now we do not convert any numbers to ints. We operate on
   strings.
*) Introduced ALTERNATE_IMG, HR, COOL_MENU, COOL_MENU_CSS and CELL tags.
*) Added register_shutdown_function to flush output buffer, if an error occurs.
*) Fixed bug with references in PHP 4.4.0
